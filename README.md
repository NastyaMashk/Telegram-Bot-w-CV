# Telegram-Bot-w-CV
Graduation project (in progress)

The chatbot is designed to increase awareness of skin cancers, in particular melanoma.
What the bot (can do):
1. determine the risk group for skin cancer based on test results.
2. distinguish between benign and malignant neoplasms based on photos.
